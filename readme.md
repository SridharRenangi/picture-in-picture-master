# Picture in Picture

The Picture in Picture app allows users to open any screen, application, or tab in a movable, resizable window that stays on top of other activities. This enables users to watch tutorial videos or engage with content while working on tasks in the background.

The project originates from the [Zero to Mastery: JavaScript Web Projects](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects) course and is the third project out of twenty.

## Reflection

I'm amazed by the simplicity of this project. Picture in Picture is an incredibly practical feature, and I never imagined I could create it with just 30 lines of code. In fact, it's even less when whitespace is removed.
